NOTE: Parallelization is limited by the small number of atoms,
      only starting 1 thread-MPI ranks.
      You can use the -nt and/or -ntmpi option to optimize the number of threads.

Changing nstlist from 10 to 100, rlist from 2 to 2

Using 1 MPI thread
Using 16 OpenMP threads 

ED: Initializing essential dynamics constraints.
