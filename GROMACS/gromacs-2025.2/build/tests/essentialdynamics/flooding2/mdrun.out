Reading file topol.tpr, VERSION 2025.2 (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 25 to 50, rlist from 1.05 to 1.115

Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

Using 8 MPI threads
Using 4 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread

50 steps,      0.1 ps.
ED: EV 1 flooding potential center:  5.0000e-01 (adding  0.0000e+00/timestep)
ED: EV 2 flooding potential center: -1.0000e-01 (adding  0.0000e+00/timestep)

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 4.1%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 37%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 1.5%.
