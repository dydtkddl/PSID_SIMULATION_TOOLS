Changing nstlist from 10 to 40, rlist from 1.014 to 1.119

Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 152.8%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 5%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 7.0%.
 Average PME mesh/force load: 1.329
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 6.5 %

NOTE: 7.0 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.
      Dynamic load balancing was automatically disabled, but it might be beneficial to manually turn it on (option -dlb yes.)
      You can also consider manually changing the decomposition (option -dd);
      e.g. by using fewer domains along the box dimension in which there is
      considerable inhomogeneity in the simulated system.
NOTE: 6.5 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had more work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to increase the number of PME ranks
      or increase the cut-off and the grid spacing.


NOTE: 29 % of the run time was spent communicating energies,
      you might want to increase some nst* mdp options
