Working dir:  /home/yongsang/Research/PSID_server_room/GROMACS/gromacs-2025.2/build/tests/complex/dec+water
Command line:
  gmx mdrun -nb cpu -notunepme

Reading file topol.tpr, VERSION 2025.2 (single precision)
Multiple energy groups is not implemented for GPUs, falling back to the CPU. For better performance, run on the GPU without energy groups and then do gmx mdrun -rerun option on the trajectory with an energy group .tpr file.

NOTE: Parallelization is limited by the small number of atoms,
      only starting 16 thread-MPI ranks.
      You can use the -nt and/or -ntmpi option to optimize the number of threads.

Changing nstlist from 5 to 20, rlist from 1.038 to 1.21


Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

Using 16 MPI threads
Using 2 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread

starting mdrun 'Olie op de Golven'
10 steps,      0.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.

NOTE: 8 % of the run time was spent in domain decomposition,
      11 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)

Thanx for Using GROMACS - Have a Nice Day
