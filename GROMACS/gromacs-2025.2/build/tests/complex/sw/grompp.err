NOTE 1 [file topol.top, line 162]:
  In moleculetype 'SW' 1 atoms are not bound by a potential or constraint
  to any other atom in the same moleculetype. Although technically this
  might not cause issues in a simulation, this often means that the user
  forgot to add a bond/potential/constraint or put multiple molecules in
  the same moleculetype definition by mistake. Run with -v to get
  information for each atom.

Number of degrees of freedom in T-Coupling group System is 1509.00
