Reading file topol.tpr, VERSION 2025.2 (single precision)
Can not increase nstlist because verlet-buffer-tolerance is not set or used
Update groups can not be used for this system because an incompatible virtual site type is used

Using 6 MPI threads
Using 6 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread

starting mdrun 'Protein'
20 steps,      0.1 ps.

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 9.4%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 15%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 1.4%.


NOTE: 7 % of the run time was spent in domain decomposition,
      11 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)
