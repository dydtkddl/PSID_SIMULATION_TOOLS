NOTE: Parallelization is limited by the small number of atoms,
      only starting 10 thread-MPI ranks.
      You can use the -nt and/or -ntmpi option to optimize the number of threads.

Changing nstlist from 10 to 100, rlist from 5.026 to 5.254

Using 10 MPI threads
Using 3 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread

starting mdrun 'Protein'
10 steps,      0.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.

NOTE: 61 % of the run time was spent communicating energies,
      you might want to increase some nst* mdp options
