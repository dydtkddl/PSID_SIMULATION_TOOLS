Reading file topol.tpr, VERSION 2025.2 (single precision)
Can not increase nstlist because verlet-buffer-tolerance is not set or used
Update groups can not be used for this system because an incompatible virtual site type is used

Using 12 MPI threads
Using 3 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread

starting mdrun 'Protein'
20 steps,      0.1 ps.

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was turned on during the run due to measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 13.1%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 21%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 2.7%.
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 0 % Y 0 %


NOTE: 10 % of the run time was spent in domain decomposition,
      11 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)
