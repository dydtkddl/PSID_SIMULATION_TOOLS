Reading file topol.tpr, VERSION 2025.2 (single precision)

NOTE: Parallelization is limited by the small number of atoms,
      only starting 6 thread-MPI ranks.
      You can use the -nt and/or -ntmpi option to optimize the number of threads.

Using 6 MPI threads
Using 6 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread

starting mdrun 'Water'
20 steps,      0.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was turned on during the run due to measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 42.9%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 40%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 17.2%.
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 0 %

NOTE: 17.2 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.
      You can consider manually changing the decomposition (option -dd);
      e.g. by using fewer domains along the box dimension in which there is
      considerable inhomogeneity in the simulated system.
