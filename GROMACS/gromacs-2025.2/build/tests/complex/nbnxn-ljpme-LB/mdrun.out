NOTE: Parallelization is limited by the small number of atoms,
      only starting 1 thread-MPI ranks.
      You can use the -nt and/or -ntmpi option to optimize the number of threads.

Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

Using 1 MPI thread
Using 16 OpenMP threads 


LJ-PME with Lorentz-Berthelot is not supported with SIMD kernels, falling back to plain C kernels

WARNING: Using the slow plain-C-4x4 kernels. This should
not happen during routine usage on common platforms.
