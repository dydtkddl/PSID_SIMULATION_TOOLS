  gmx mdrun -notunepme

Reading file topol.tpr, VERSION 2025.2 (single precision)

NOTE: Parallelization is limited by the small number of atoms,
      only starting 8 thread-MPI ranks.
      You can use the -nt and/or -ntmpi option to optimize the number of threads.

Using 8 MPI threads
Using 4 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread

starting mdrun 'Water'
20 steps,      0.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 8.6%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 20%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 1.7%.


NOTE: 12 % of the run time was spent in domain decomposition,
      9 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)

NOTE: 10 % of the run time was spent communicating energies,
      you might want to increase some nst* mdp options
