Command line:
  gmx mdrun -notunepme

Reading file topol.tpr, VERSION 2025.2 (single precision)

NOTE: Parallelization is limited by the small number of atoms,
      only starting 6 thread-MPI ranks.
      You can use the -nt and/or -ntmpi option to optimize the number of threads.

Can not increase nstlist because an NVE ensemble is used
Using 6 MPI threads
Using 6 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread

starting mdrun 'Water'
10 steps,      0.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 3.9%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 25%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 1.0%.


NOTE: 35 % of the run time was spent communicating energies,
      you might want to increase some nst* mdp options
