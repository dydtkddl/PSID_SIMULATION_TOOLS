Reading file topol.tpr, VERSION 2025.2 (single precision)

NOTE: Parallelization is limited by the small number of atoms,
      only starting 24 thread-MPI ranks.
      You can use the -nt and/or -ntmpi option to optimize the number of threads.

Changing nstlist from 10 to 100, rlist from 0.9 to 1.023

Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

Using 24 MPI threads
Using 1 OpenMP thread per tMPI thread

starting mdrun 'water+hexane'
20 steps,      0.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.

NOTE: 10 % of the run time was spent communicating energies,
      you might want to increase some nst* mdp options
