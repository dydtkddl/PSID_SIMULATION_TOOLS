Command line:
  gmx mdrun -notunepme

Reading file topol.tpr, VERSION 2025.2 (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 10 to 100, rlist from 1.4 to 1.539

Using 36 MPI threads
Using 1 OpenMP thread per tMPI thread

starting mdrun 'Pure Methanol - Yummie!'
20 steps,      0.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.

NOTE: 2 % of the run time was spent in domain decomposition,
      10 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)

NOTE: 37 % of the run time was spent communicating energies,
      you might want to increase some nst* mdp options
