Reading file topol.tpr, VERSION 2025.2 (single precision)

NOTE: Parallelization is limited by the small number of atoms,
      only starting 16 thread-MPI ranks.
      You can use the -nt and/or -ntmpi option to optimize the number of threads.

Changing nstlist from 5 to 50, rlist from 1.004 to 1.094

Using 16 MPI threads
Using 2 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread

starting mdrun 'Ch3cn'
20 steps,      0.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.

NOTE: 20 % of the run time was spent communicating energies,
      you might want to increase some nst* mdp options
