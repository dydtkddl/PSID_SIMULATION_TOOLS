NOTE: Parallelization is limited by the small number of atoms,
      only starting 4 thread-MPI ranks.
      You can use the -nt and/or -ntmpi option to optimize the number of threads.

Changing nstlist from 10 to 100, rlist from 1 to 1.026

Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

Using 4 MPI threads
Using 8 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread
