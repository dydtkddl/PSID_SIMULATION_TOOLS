Working dir:  /home/yongsang/Research/PSID_server_room/GROMACS/gromacs-2025.2/build/tests/complex/nbnxn-energy-groups
Command line:
  gmx mdrun -nb cpu -notunepme

Reading file topol.tpr, VERSION 2025.2 (single precision)
Multiple energy groups is not implemented for GPUs, falling back to the CPU. For better performance, run on the GPU without energy groups and then do gmx mdrun -rerun option on the trajectory with an energy group .tpr file.

NOTE: Parallelization is limited by the small number of atoms,
      only starting 24 thread-MPI ranks.
      You can use the -nt and/or -ntmpi option to optimize the number of threads.

Changing nstlist from 10 to 100, rlist from 0.9 to 1.023


Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints
