Reading file topol.tpr, VERSION 2025.2 (single precision)

NOTE: Parallelization is limited by the small number of atoms,
      only starting 8 thread-MPI ranks.
      You can use the -nt and/or -ntmpi option to optimize the number of threads.

Can not increase nstlist because verlet-buffer-tolerance is not set or used
Using 8 MPI threads
Using 4 OpenMP threads per tMPI thread

20 steps,      0.0 ps (continuing from step 5,      0.0 ps).

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 9.7%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 19%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 1.8%.


NOTE: 9 % of the run time was spent in domain decomposition,
      12 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)

NOTE: 10 % of the run time was spent communicating energies,
      you might want to increase some nst* mdp options
