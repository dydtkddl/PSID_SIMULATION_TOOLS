Changing nstlist from 10 to 40, rlist from 1.014 to 1.119

Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

Using 36 MPI threads
Using 1 OpenMP thread per tMPI thread

SWAP: Determining initial numbers of ions per compartment.
SWAP: Setting pointers for checkpoint writing
SWAP: Channel 0 flux history for ion type NA+ (charge 1): 0 molecules
SWAP: Channel 1 flux history for ion type NA+ (charge 1): 0 molecules

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run due to low measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 15.4%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 4%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 0.6%.
 Average PME mesh/force load: 1.941
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 17.1 %

NOTE: 17.1 % performance was lost because the PME ranks
      had more work to do than the PP ranks.
      You might want to increase the number of PME ranks
      or increase the cut-off and the grid spacing.
