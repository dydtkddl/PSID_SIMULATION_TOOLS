Reading file topol.tpr, VERSION 2025.2 (single precision)

NOTE: Parallelization is limited by the small number of atoms,
      only starting 24 thread-MPI ranks.
      You can use the -nt and/or -ntmpi option to optimize the number of threads.

Changing nstlist from 10 to 100, rlist from 1 to 1.031

Update groups can not be used for this system because there are three or more consecutively coupled constraints

Using 24 MPI threads
Using 1 OpenMP thread per tMPI thread

starting mdrun 'water+hexane'
20 steps,      0.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.

NOTE: 9 % of the run time was spent communicating energies,
      you might want to increase some nst* mdp options
